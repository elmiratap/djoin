Local Datastore 
Parse also lets you store objects in a local datastore on the Android device itself. 
You can use this for data that doesn't need to be saved to the cloud, but this is especially 
useful for temporarily storing data so that it can be synced later. 
To enable the datastore, call Parse.enableLocalDatastore() in your Application 
constructor before calling Parse.initialize(). Once the local datastore is enabled, 
you can store an object by pinning it.

ParseObject gameScore = new ParseObject("GameScore");
gameScore.put("score", 1337);
gameScore.put("playerName", "Sean Plott");
gameScore.put("cheatMode", false);
gameScore.pinInBackground();

As with saving, this recursively stores every object and file that gameScore points to, 
if it has been fetched from the cloud. Whenever you save changes to the object, or fetch 
new changes from Parse, the copy in the datastore will be automatically updated, so you 
don't have to worry about it.

Unpinning Objects
When you are done with the object and no longer need to keep it on the device, you can 
release it with unpinInBackground.

gameScore.unpinInBackground();
